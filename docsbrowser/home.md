# Canonical Kubernetes

**K8s** is a low-ops, minimal production Kubernetes. 

MicroK8s is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerised applications. It provides the functionality of core Kubernetes components, in a small footprint, scalable from a single node to a high-availability production cluster.

By reducing the resource commitments required in order to run Kubernetes, MicroK8s makes it possible to take Kubernetes into new environments, for example:

* turning Kubernetes into lightweight development tool
* making Kubernetes available for use in minimal environments such as GitHub CI
* adapting Kubernetes for small-appliance IoT applications

Developers use MicroK8s as an inexpensive proving ground for new ideas. In production, ISVs benefit from lower overheads and resource demands and shorter development cycles, enabling them to ship appliances faster than ever.

The MicroK8s ecosystem includes dozens of useful **Addons** - extensions that provide additional functionality and features. See list of [Addons][], [How to manage Addons][].
